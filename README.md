### 💬 About me  

I love the idea of **building something from nothing**, turning a blank screen into a real, working solution that helps people.  
Coding, for me, is like construction: you start from raw ground, you make mistakes, you face challenges, you iterate, you adjust, and at the end, you stand in front of something you’ve built with pride.  

I originally studied computer science as a **specialization during my final year of high school**,  
then completed the **first year of an IT technical degree (BTS SIO)**,  
which combined the advanced basics of **networking and software development**.  
After exploring entrepreneurship and other jobs, I decided to come back to what always felt natural to me, **technology and creation**.  

Today, I’m strengthening my development skills at **_ETNA_**,  
a generalist Master program where I’m learning various areas such as **object-oriented programming**, **DevOps fundamentals**, and **web development**, before specializing next year.  

I’m still learning, and I don’t pretend otherwise.  
My goal is to progressively reach **industry-level standards** in code quality, structure, and documentation.  
Not perfect code, but code that makes sense, that evolves, and that helps.  
I’m not chasing perfection, I’m chasing **progress**.  

It’s rewarding seeing a project evolve, step by step, line by line.
