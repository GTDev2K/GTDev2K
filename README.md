### 💬 About me  

I love the idea of **building something from nothing** — turning a blank screen into a real, working solution that helps people.  
Coding, for me, is like construction: you start from raw ground, you make mistakes, you face challenges, you iterate, you adjust,  
and at the end, you stand in front of something you’ve built with pride.  
It’s rewarding seeing a project evolve, step by step, line after line.  

I originally studied computer science as a **specialization during my final year of high school**,  
then completed the **first year of an IT technical degree (BTS SIO)**,  
which combined the advanced basics of **networking and software development**.  
After exploring entrepreneurship and other jobs, I decided to come back to what always felt natural to me — **technology and creation**.  

Today, I’m strengthening my development skills at **ETNA**,  
a generalist Master program where I’m learning various areas such as **object-oriented programming**,  
**DevOps fundamentals**, and **web development**, before specializing next year.  

I’m still learning — and I don’t pretend otherwise.  
My goal is to progressively reach **industry-level standards** in code quality, structure, and documentation.  
Not perfect code, but code that makes sense, that evolves, and that helps.  
I’m not chasing perfection; I’m chasing **progress**.  

I’m looking for a **human, modern, and formative environment**  
where I can keep improving, contribute to real projects,  
and grow into a developer capable of building meaningful solutions.
